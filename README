NAME
    Plack::Handler::AnyEvent::HTTPD - Plack handler to run PSGI apps on
    AnyEvent::HTTPD

SYNOPSIS
      plackup -s AnyEvent::HTTPD --port 9090

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Handler::AnyEvent::HTTPD is a Plack handler to run PSGI apps on
    AnyEvent::HTTPD module.

FEATURES
    It's a handler running on AnyEvent::HTTPD so it inherits all the
    features from that, but the implementation is a bit tweaked to bypass
    some restrictions that AnyEvent::HTTPD has, i.e.:

    *   AnyEvent::HTTPD only supports GET and POST but this handler supports
        other methods too.

    *   AnyEvent::HTTPD processes "x-www-form-urlencoded" and
        "multipart/form-data" but this handler turns off that processing and
        just pushes the buffered content to "psgi.input"

LIMITATIONS
    *   "$env->{SERVER_PROTOCOL}" is always *HTTP/1.0* regardless of the
        request version.
